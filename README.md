# My Generative Game POC

This project is a proof of concept (POC) for a generative text-based game that simulates NPCs (Non-Player Characters) using Rasa, a conversational AI framework. Each NPC has its own unique knowledge and personality, and the game is configured through external files.

## Features

- **NPC Simulation:** Each NPC has its own dialogue and memory, managed by separate conversation trackers in Rasa.
- **Configurable Game:** The game story and NPC personalities are defined through configuration files, allowing easy updates and extensions.
- **Rasa API:** The project uses Rasa's built-in REST API to manage conversations and interactions.
